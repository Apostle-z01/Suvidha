We have made an android app named Suvidha that allows you to search for doctors and hospitals, take online appointments and also
get doctor recommendations based on user ratings and reviews.

The motivation for making this app was the dearth of any app or service that would help one to know about the doctors in his
nearby area and good doctors.

There is an emergency button in the app that a user can click in an emergency situation and the app would find the nearest
hospital by automatically extracting the userâ€™s current location and notifying the nearest hospital, without the need for
logging in.

Three different users can log in: Patient, Doctor, Hospital.

As a patient user, the patient can search for doctors based on their ratings, their area of specializations, their proximity to
the doctor by extracting the patients coordinates and computing the distances using Havesine distance formula.
A patient can rate doctors, and add reviews about them for other users to view.
A patient can also take online apppointments from any doctor(that allows online appointment) and be notified about its
acceptance/rejection status, using Bluemix Push Service.
A patient can also view the hospitals near him, and the doctors that are working in the hospital and their area of
specialization.

As a doctor user, the doctor can choose to take online appointments and specify his availability of dates. 
The doctor can see his ratings and reviews, and accept/reject appointments. 

As a hospital user, the hospital can add doctors to its hospital.

Everything is speech enabled as well, for instance searching for doctors via speech, searching for hospitals,etc.
We have also implemented autofill while searching for doctors, if a user frequently visits a doctor.
